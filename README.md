About
=====

  Octoprint-Cmd-Shell (OCS) is an environment was written in the
  Python_ programming language with the aim of querying, and managing 
  Octoprint-controlled 3D print jobs. The Octoprint-shell has been 
  constructed with a number of "design goals" that make it:


- **Easy to use**:

  It is simple for new users to get access to all of the functionality
  of OCS.

- **Flexible**:

  Since OCS is based on the Python scripting language it is possible
  to perform very complicated tasks without any code modifications.

- **Customizable**:

  The Python code in OPS is structured using object-oriented code to make 
  it simple to contribute new functionality to OCS.

- **Pythonic**:

  It fits nicely into the rest of the Python world with
  use of the popular packages. The use of the Python language 
  allows OCS to be used both interactively
  as well as in scripts.

- **Open to participation**:
